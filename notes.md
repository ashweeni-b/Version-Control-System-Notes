## 1. Introduction

- Version Control System (VCS) is a tool used to track and manage the changes in project's codebase. <br>
- Multiple developers can work simulataneously on the same project without conflicts. <br>
- Useful for maintaining history of all the changes and enable easy rollback to the previous versions if needed.

---

## 2. Features

- Tracks changes over time<br>
- Collaboration <br>
- Code History and Audit Trails <br>
- Backup and Recovery <br>
- Branching and merging

<blockquote><b>Notes:</b><br>
Local Repository - Project version is stored in the computer <br>
Remote Repository - Project version is stored on a server accessible to other <br>

## 3. Types

1. Local Version Control System <br>
2. Centralized Version Control System <br>
3. Distributed Version Control System <br>

<ol>
<li> Local Version Control System </li>
- No remote repository <br>
- No collaboration <br>
- All files are stored locally within local system and local database <br>

<li>Centralized Version Control System </li>
- Remote repository is present <br>
- Multiple developers can collaborate <br>
- Changes are saved directly to the remote repository only <br>
- Risk of modifications in other developers work <br>

<li> Distributed Version Control System </li>
- Remote repository is present <br>
- Multiple developers can collaborate <br>
- Developers creates a copy of the remote repo in the local system, known as local repo <br>
- Each developer works on the local repository <br>
- Changes are first saved in the local repository and then it is saved to the remote repository <br>

## 4. Examples

- Centralized Version Control System - Subversion (SVN), Perforce P4, ClearCase <br>
- Distributed Version Control System - Git, Mercurial, Unity Version Control <br>

## 5. Questions

1. What is the difference between a distributed and a centralized version control system? <br>
2. What are the different types of version control systems? Why is Git preferred? <br>
